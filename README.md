### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2021

+ Projec title: How Immigrants influence elections
+ This project is conducted by Dennis Shpits

+ Project summary: Immigration does not only change the dynamics of the labor market, but might also change election outcomes. Recently there have been rumors that the Democratic party plans on securing more votes in elections by increasing immigration. This analysis will try to provide statistical evidence of whether this assumtion holds water.
